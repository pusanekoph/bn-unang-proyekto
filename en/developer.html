            <h3>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis game was made by a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/nagniningning.na.tala/">Pusaneko Mascot</a> with the founder of <a href="https://pusanekoph.github.io/pusanekoph/index.html">Pusaneko</a>. They did this for months and struggled to code this game just to make all of the mystery lovers happy. As well as for those people who is looking for Tagalog/Filipino Visual Novel. I hope you will support us in our next project so that we can gain motivation and skills in what we are currently doing.</h3>
